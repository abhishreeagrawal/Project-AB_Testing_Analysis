# Project-AB_Testing_Analysis
An AB test analysis using python to compare the performance of new v/s old landing web pages. 

A/B testing is a statistical technique - a randomized controlled experiment where two or more versions of a variable (such as a landing page, page element, marketing campaign, etc.) are shown to different groups of users and compared to see which one performs better and drives the success metric.
In this project, I am analyzing the AB test results for two different versions of product page for online e-commerce business, with the objective of increasing conversion rate. The current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and the team is targeting a lift of 2%.
The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle. 

The analysis description is in the summary document and the code is in the jupyter ipynb file.
